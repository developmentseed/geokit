- bbox             Gets the bbox of a geojson file.
- bbox2fc          Converts a bbox to FeatureCollection.
- buffer           Creates buffer in LineString features for a given radius.
- clip             Gets only the features that are inside the given boundary and it deletes all features outside the boundary'

- line2polygon     Changes the type of geometry from LineString to Polygon.
- fc2frows         Sets each feature into a row from FeatureCollection.
- fc2csv           Adds an osm_download_link column per each feature and each link downloads the feature in JOSM'
- filterbyprop     Filters features by given property.
- filterbygeometry Filters features by given one or many geometry types.
- countfeature     Gets the total number of features that exist inside the a geojson file.
- featurearea      Gets the area in hectares of each feature (polygon) into a geojson file.
- countbysize      Counts features larger than the given area size in hectares.
- point2tile       Create geojson of the tiles which cover the collections of points.
- difference       Filter the difference between two files: <File1.geojson> - <file2.geojson> --key==school_code.
- duplicatefeatures  Check if duplicate objects by an attribute.
- point2tile       Pass a geojson with points and get the nearest tiles to this point in a geojson file.                
- tilecover        Pass a polygon and get the tiles which cover all the polygon at a certain zoom.
