Commands:
- area              Gets the total area in kmÂ² of Polygon and MultiPolygon features that there are in a GeoJSON file.
- featurearea       Gets the area in ha of each feature (polygon) into a GeoJSON file and it will generate a new GeoJSON file with all features plus an area property.
- countfeature      Gets the total number of features that exist inside the GeoJSON file.
- distance          Gets the total distance in km of LineString and MultiLineString features that there are in a GeoJSON file.
- featuredistance   Adds the distance as an attribute; it contains the length in kilometers that has each feature in a GeoJSON file.
- bbox2fc           Converts a bounding box to FeatureCollection.
- bbox              Gets the bounding box of a FeatureCollection.
- buffer            Creates buffer in LineString features for a given radius. 
- line2polygon      Changes the type of geometry from LineString to Polygon.
- fc2square         Creates features square for a given radius in meters, in case of Polygon and LineString the script takes the centroid to generate the square.
- featurebbox       Gets the bbox of each feature in a GeoJSON file and add it as a attribute.
- renamekey         Changes a key name in each features in the GeoJSON file.
- deletenulls       Deletes the attributes that have a null value.
- centroid          Gets the centroid of the features.
- point2tile        Pass a GeoJSON file with points and gets the nearest tiles to this points.
- tilecover         Pass a polygon and gets the tiles which cover all the polygon at a certain zoom level. 
- splitbyzoom       Divides the features in a GeoJSON file according to a given zoom level (works for zoom <= 15), and it will generate GeoJSON files into a folder.
- fc2frows          Sets each feature into a row from FeatureCollection.
- jsonlines2geojson Gets a GeoJSON file from JSON file.

Also you can use these commands

- geojsontoosm     Converts GeoJSON file to osm format.
- osmtogeojson     Converts OSM file to GeoJSON format.
- geojson2poly     Converts GeoJSON polygons to OpenStreetMap (OSM) poly format file.
